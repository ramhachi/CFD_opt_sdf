# Authoritative Roadmap: Generic Aerodynamic Topology Optimization

Date: 2026-09-09
Status: authoritative
Scope: generic rigid-object external aerodynamics with topology change
Architecture decision: adopted on 2026-09-09

This is the only implementation roadmap for the project. Historical
body-fitted, parametric, and front-wing-specific work is capability evidence,
not a second development plan. The front wing remains the final complex
benchmark; it does not define the product architecture.

## September 2026 cross-platform implementation

The accepted [32 GB development design](development_plan_2026_09.md) and
[critical architecture review](architecture_review_2026_09.md) specify the
Mac/Windows extension. This page remains the authoritative progress record.
The existing G1–G4 gates below remain mandatory; the P0–P5 milestones in the
design are work packages, not substitutes for those gates.

The project adopts this architecture as its production direction: one shared
ProblemSpec and evidence contract, density/Brinkman topology exploration, SDF
sharp-interface refinement, and independent body-fitted verification. Backend
promotion remains conditional on the numerical and physical gates below. In
particular, adopting the architecture does not promote the current periodic
LBM probe to a target-aerodynamics solver.

The `main` snapshot immediately before this decision is preserved as
`artifact/pre-cross-platform-architecture-2026-09-09` at commit `fdc1053`.

The first implementation adds bounded `research` commands for runtime
inspection, STL/declared-feature preflight, and a periodic D2Q9 Taylor–Green
reference with an optional Apple Silicon Metal backend. These are P0/P1
foundations. CPU execution is portable; Metal acceleration requires Apple
Silicon. Windows CUDA acceleration is still pending. A working RTX 4070 Ti
must be qualified against its separate VRAM budget, not 32 GB host RAM.

The geometry preflight checks only its explicitly listed subset. Periodic
LBM has no wall treatment, force integration, SDF coupling, adjoint, or 3D
support. Neither its passing benchmark nor a successful OpenFOAM process
qualifies target aerodynamics or a complete optimization pipeline.

Next execution order:

1. Establish reproducible runtime and numerical evidence on Mac and Windows.
2. Validate wall treatment, force integration and spatial convergence on
   bounded laminar cases before coupling an SDF interface.
3. Add CUDA only behind the same reference tests and report memory/precision
   separately for each device.
4. Validate stationary residuals and directional derivatives before adjoints
   and constrained shape optimization; retain the existing density/Brinkman
   route for topology work and independent body-fitted verification.

See [cross-platform commands and evidence](cross_platform_research.md).

## 1. Product objective

Build a configuration-driven optimizer that can add, remove, join, and split
material inside a bounded design domain for an arbitrary STL-defined rigid
object, subject to aerodynamic, geometric, connectivity, and manufacturing
constraints.

The first supported product profile is deliberately bounded:

- incompressible low-Mach external flow;
- steady or quasi-steady analysis;
- one rigid material;
- STL-only geometry roles;
- uniform Cartesian fixed-grid topology optimization;
- SDF extraction/refinement followed by body-fitted verification.

Compressible flow, fully unsteady flow, fluid-structure interaction, free
surfaces, and production AMR are future capability profiles.

## 2. Authoritative architecture

```

The Stage T design variable is the cell density field `rho`. STL is an input
surface or a derived exchange/verification artifact; it is not the main
topology design variable.

## 3. Evidence rules

Every result must be labelled as one of the following:

| Evidence class | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Contract | Schemas, IDs, hashes, and validation agree. No solver claim. |
| Capability | A backend operation can run on a canonical fixture. |
| Numerical | Residual, mass-balance, stationarity, and gradient gates pass. |
| Target physics | The declared operating point and physics pass cross-fidelity checks. |
| Benchmark | A configured geometry family passes the complete acceptance set. |

Capability or contract evidence must never be reported as target-physics
validation. An `execution_ready` ProblemSpec means the declarations are
complete; it does not mean the mesh, fields, solver, or result are qualified.

## 4. Current position

| Workstream | Status | Current evidence and gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G0 scope/evidence model | Complete | Generic rigid-object scope and evidence classes are established. |
| G1 ProblemSpec/artifact contract | Complete | v2 parsing, canonical hash, multipoint responses, topology policy, v1 read-only migration, and semantic readers exist. |
| G2 case compiler | Current-spec numerical convergence passed; physical/native-artifact qualification pending | On 2026-09-07 both freshly compiled flows passed the declared primal, response, adjoint and normalized-mass convergence gates under the current specification hash. See `evidence/openfoam_convergence_2026_09.json`. Response-unit, gradient and grid-transfer semantics plus porous/body-fitted comparisons remain unqualified. |
| G3 geometry/resolution gates | Partial — bounded STL/declared-resolution preflight | `research preflight` checks STL metadata and declared feature/grid ratios. Self-intersection, actual shape thickness/clearance, complete mask/connectivity and density-to-SDF fidelity qualification remain. |
| G4 benchmark ladder | Missing — implementation required | No complete three-family, three-grid generic acceptance set exists. |
| Stage T canonical backend | Narrow numerical gate passed | Fixed-grid Brinkman primal/adjoints converged on the 8192-cell laminar fixture. At move/epsilon `1e-4`, directional derivatives agreed with finite differences within 2.23–4.35%, and an objective-only update agreed with primal re-evaluation within 4.51%. Move `0.03` was outside the useful local regime. See `architecture_effectiveness_2026_09.md`. |
| Stage T canonical closed loop | Gradient chain verified; optimization still missing | On 2026-09-12 the full loop ran on real OpenFOAM: canonical 46080-cell `rho` -> `P @ rho` -> injection into the 2909 active source cells -> converged primal/adjoints -> `P.T @ topOSens` -> canonical gradient. Finite differences on the canonical grid agreed with the analytic directional derivative to 1.03%-0.56% (ratio 0.990 -> 0.994) along the gradient direction over 16 converged runs. The cell-order permutation is now measured, not assumed. Two limits are recorded: `top_o_sensitivity_gradient` is `d(+downforce)/drho`, the negative of `dJ/drho`; and a generic localized direction retains an unexplained ratio of approximately 0.90 that neither a two-decade residual tightening nor disabling regularisation removes. See `p0_openfoam_closed_loop_2026_09.md`. |
| Stage T production optimizer | P0 candidate and state-transfer capability added; numerical qualification remains missing | Stage T candidate lineage can be bound fail-closed to a native ProblemSpec, canonical grid, STL-derived masks, and exact topology/density hashes. Canonical rho can be conservatively transferred to a uniform Cartesian OpenFOAM source grid with `source = P @ target`; the artifact remains `qualified=false`. Direction suites carry the verified candidate identity into plus/minus topology states, and the gradient gate rejects mixed objectives, binding mismatches, and incomplete direction-by-epsilon coverage. The real G2 run still awaits solver-field consumption of the state artifact, candidate-bound `P.T` gradient return, semantic response-unit and topology-value bindings, fresh multi-direction FD evidence, production connectivity derivatives, nonlinear acceptance/rollback, checkpoint/resume, and a GCMMA-equivalent iteration. |
| Stage S | Cell-density handoff capability added; never yet given a real design | Stage T cell-data `rho` can be converted to a hash-bound iso-surface and SDF with explicit interpolation, threshold, grid, mask, component and root-availability diagnostics. Its repeated `diagnostic_only` verdicts were **not** a handoff defect: every input it was ever given was degenerate, because Stage T never produced material (see below). Quantitative acceptance gates, a re-run on a real design, and a qualified sharp-interface solver all remain missing. No SDF evolution exists at all — no Hamilton-Jacobi update, reinitialization, or normal velocity from a shape gradient. |
| Stage V | Prototype, now drivable from the native v2 spec | Body-fitted snappyHexMesh execution exists and, as of 2026-09-12, can be driven directly from a native v2 `ProblemSpec` with an explicit candidate STL, recording `problem_spec_sha256` and the meshed STL hash, at a selectable mesh resolution. `forceCoeffs` now derives `Aref`/`lRef`/`dragDir`/`liftDir` from declared reference values and response directions and reports Newtons alongside coefficients, matching the Stage T `0.5*rho*A*U^2` convention. Target-profile grid convergence and cross-fidelity acceptance remain. |

The 2026-09-10 effectiveness spike proves only local numerical control inside
the fixed-grid Brinkman model. It does not prove constrained optimization or
the Stage T -> Stage S -> Stage V architecture end to end. The canonical start
is infeasible for the recorded efficiency and active-cell mean-`rho` limits,
and the current T5 output cannot be passed as the same candidate to Stage S/V.

### Stage T has never produced a design — 2026-09-12

This invalidates every prior Stage T optimization result and every Stage S
handoff attempt. Three separate defects were measured, not inferred.

1. **The declared problem was degenerate.** The repository template
   `examples/fixed_grid_backend_spike/openfoam/porous_force_3d_fd_base/system/optimisationDict`
   declares `downforce` with `isConstraint true; target 0;` and `drag` as the
   only weighted objective. The problem actually solved was "minimize drag
   subject to downforce == 0 and volume fraction == 0.462". Any material
   creates vertical force and violates the equality, so the optimizer stays at
   zero material. This is the repository's own template, not a stray work
   artifact.
2. **The volume constraint does not engage.** Reformulating `downforce` as a
   `weight -1` maximization objective did not help. Across a 40-cycle run and a
   20-cycle run the design converged to the same fixed point: beta histogram
   `[8080, 2, 110, 0, 0, 0]` over bins `[0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0]`, mean
   0.0070, **zero cells above 0.5**, realized volume fraction approximately
   0.007 against the 0.462 target. The `vol` objective value is frozen near
   1.1493 in both runs and its Lagrange multiplier is pinned at approximately
   1.99999999, which equals the ISQP penalty parameter `c = 2`.
3. **The iso-surfaces handed to Stage S were not design surfaces.** Every
   `topOIsoSurface*.stl` from every cycle of every run is identical: 5120 faces,
   2822 vertices, not watertight, 6 connected components sized
   `[1024, 1024, 1024, 1024, 512, 512]`, bounds exactly equal to the domain box.
   That is the six flat boundary patches of the 32x16x16 domain. A 0.5
   iso-surface of a field that never reaches 0.5 has nothing to trace.

### Root cause, and the optimizer decision — 2026-09-12

The native ISQP path was diagnosed against the OpenFOAM v2512 sources. Three
independent faults, detailed in `stage_t_optimizer_diagnosis_2026_09.md`:

- `topOVolume`'s `percentage` is a **fluid-fraction cap over the whole mesh**,
  `J = (1 - <beta>_V - percentage)/percentage`. With the template's 0.462 and
  the 5283 forced-fluid buffer cells out of 8192, the minimum attainable `J` is
  `+0.396 > 0`: the constraint is **unsatisfiable by construction**. The
  observed frozen value 1.1497 matches the formula exactly.
- The multiplier pinned at the ISQP penalty `c` is the genuine elastic-variable
  signature of that infeasibility, not a red herring. The volume sensitivity is
  ~4000x smaller than the drag sensitivity, so it is invisible in the QP.
- `function linear` makes the projection the identity, so no 0.5 crossing can
  form at all. The tutorials use `tanh; b 20`.

With those repaired, the native path does produce real watertight design
components (one run reached downforce 1.029 against a 0.636 baseline), but it
still oscillates: an Armijo line search hits its iteration cap every cycle,
showing the ISQP direction is not a descent direction for the projected
problem. This is not a gradient error.

**Decision: optimization moves to Python permanently.** Optimality-criteria
updates on the same verified adjoint gradient advanced monotonically from the
first attempt (see below). The OpenFOAM template is retained as a primal and
adjoint evaluator only; its `vol` constraint solver and its `downforce`-as-
constraint solver should be removed, keeping `drag` and `downforce` as
independent adjoint solvers.

Also recorded: the 5120-face / 6-component STL signature arises because the
iso-surface writer always emits the domain boundary patches. **Stage S must
strip zero-extent components**, or a real design component stays buried among
them.

### Stage T produced its first design — 2026-09-12

Driving the update from Python with the verified canonical gradient and an
optimality-criteria step (volume by bisection, move limit, reject-on-worse),
`downforce_coefficient` rose monotonically from the 0.775975568032 baseline to
0.821317856508 over 12 iterations, every step accepted on its first attempt,
with the iteration-0 sign check agreeing to three digits. The resulting 0.5
iso-surface is 968 faces, 488 vertices, **watertight, 2 connected components**,
volume 0.0249 — not the degenerate signature — and `build_density_to_sdf_handoff`
accepts it with all mask and connectivity checks passing. An empty design
(`rho = 0`) returns `drag = downforce = 0.0` exactly, confirming the objective
carries no geometry-independent offset.

The known limit is structural: a multiplicative OC update cannot lift a cell off
exact zero, so achievable volume caps near 3.2% on this seed without an epsilon
floor.

## 5. G1 — generic problem and artifact contract

Status: complete.

The contract provides:

- coordinate frame and SI units;
- typed STL geometry roles;
- one or more flow cases with fluid, turbulence, boundary, and motion data;
- named force, moment, pressure-loss, flow-rate, and plugin responses;
- weighted objectives and aggregate constraints;
- solid/void connectivity and minimum-feature topology policies;
- deterministic snapshots and SHA-256 problem binding;
- flow-scoped and topology-scoped artifact keys;
- non-destructive v1 migration/read support.

G1 completion is contract evidence only.

## 6. G2 — solver compiler and target-physics bridge

Status: prior-spec numerical convergence gate passed; current canonical-domain
specification requires runtime requalification before physics qualification.

Implemented:

- `compile-openfoam-problem-cases` CLI;
- deterministic per-flow OpenFOAM cases and bundle metadata;
- incompressible Newtonian fluid properties;
- laminar and `k_omega_sst` profiles;
- freestream, pressure outlet, symmetry, stationary wall, and moving wall BCs;
- translation motion profiles;
- force-response adjoint managers and reference quantities;
- `Allrun`/`Allclean` and custom objective-library staging;
- fail-fast execution scripts;
- mesh patch-type compilation and requested/generated validation;
- primal/adjoint residual, normalized mass balance, response stationarity, and
  fatal-log convergence qualification.
- OpenFOAM v2512 Docker smoke execution for both configured G2 flow cases;
- real log extraction with response-to-adjoint context and provenance-bound,
  fail-closed convergence evidence.
- explicit boundary-`phi` mass-flux measurement and normalized-mass artifacts;
  raw continuity-error text is never converted into that metric.
- fail-closed native v2 primal/sensitivity writer and readiness CLI. It writes
  only when an explicit semantic binding proves response units, `rho` gradient
  convention, mesh-grid correspondence, and topology-policy values.
- fail-closed reconstruction of final decomposed `topOSens`, `alphaTilda`,
  `beta`, and raw-`alpha` provenance in OpenFOAM global-cell-label order;
  raw `topologySens` remains audit-only.
- source-grid reconstruction for one ungraded, axis-aligned `blockMesh` hex,
  plus hash-bound canonical-grid snapshots and exact-overlap transfer
  primitives. These contracts do not yet perform a real G2 transfer.

Current supported response compilation is force-only. Moment, pressure loss,
flow rate, rotating-wall motion, and plugin responses must be rejected
explicitly until implemented.

Remaining implementation:

1. Supply and qualify semantic bindings for native v2 primal and sensitivity
   artifacts from real runs. Both G2 flows were recompiled, rerun and numerically
   qualified under the current hash on 2026-09-07. Native export still requires
   evidence for the following semantic issues: its
   `porousDirectionalForce` output is a coefficient rather than proven `N`,
   its final `topOSens` to `rho` chain has not passed finite-difference
   validation, its reconstructed mesh fields have not been transferred to a
   canonical-grid snapshot, and it has no topology-policy values.
2. Qualify wall-distance/turbulence treatment; current `meshWave` metadata is
   not porous-aware and remains unqualified.
3. Compare porous and body-fitted pressure force, skin friction, total force,
   and gradient direction on simple geometries.

G2 smoke gate:

- compilation is `compile_ready=true`;
- requested/generated values and patch types match exactly;
- all setup applications and solver initialization complete without fatal
  errors;
- a run artifact is written even when the deliberately short smoke run is not
  numerically converged.

G2 qualification gate:

- all configured flow cases pass residual, normalized mass-balance, response
  stationarity, and adjoint-residual thresholds;
- porous/body-fitted comparisons are within documented tolerances;
- execution qualification is never inferred from an end marker alone.

## 7. G3 — geometry and physical-resolution gates

Status: partial — bounded STL and declared-resolution preflight implemented.
The full gate below remains required; the new command reports omitted checks.

Implement:

- unit and coordinate-frame validation;
- watertightness, orientation, self-intersection, and degenerate-face checks;
- fail-closed voxelization for critical roles;
- cells-per-feature checks for minimum solid width, void width, and gap;
- rejection when erosion/dilation radius is smaller than represented spacing;
- density-to-SDF volume error, surface/Hausdorff error, hard-mask violations,
  component/root preservation, and feature-survival metrics.

Acceptance fixtures must prove that a one-cell bridge fails, a sufficiently
wide bridge passes, and a no-op erosion cannot be reported as manufacturing
evidence.

## 8. G4 — benchmark ladder

Status: missing — implementation required.

Advance using YAML/STL replacement rather than benchmark-specific core code:

1. B0 geometry: sphere, box, thin plate, multiple components, invalid STL.
2. B1 numerical topology: islands and two-to-six-cell bridges; cellwise and
   filtered-random derivative checks.
3. B2 laminar 2D/2.5D: channel, cylinder, and NACA with three grids.
4. B3 turbulent bridge: flat plate and NACA porous/body-fitted comparison.
5. B4 generic 3D: finite wing, bluff body, and multi-component object.
6. B5 front wing: isolated wing, moving ground, roots/endplates, then optional
   vehicle and rotating-tire profiles.

Generic acceptance requires at least three geometry families, three-grid
evidence, filtered-random gradient checks, grey-density reporting,
extracted-geometry constraint status, and reproducibility metadata.

## 9. Stage T — production topology optimizer

Begin production T work only after G2 runtime qualification and the relevant
G3/G4 gates pass.

Implementation order:

1. Qualify real-run semantic bindings for the implemented fail-closed native
   v2 primal/sensitivity writer.
2. Generic response/objective/aggregate derivative assembly.
3. Production analytic/adjoint nominal and eroded connectivity derivatives.
4. Filter/projection continuation with explicit chain-rule metadata.
5. Nonlinear iteration with primal re-evaluation, acceptance/rollback, move
   bounds, checkpoints, resume, and deterministic artifacts.
6. GCMMA or equivalent constrained backend behind the existing optimizer
   interface.
7. Mesh epochs and conservative state/gradient transfer only after the uniform
   fixed-grid profile is qualified.

The existing projected-gradient and linearized SLSQP backends validate
plumbing; they are not the production nonlinear optimizer.

## 10. Stage S and Stage V

Stage S implementation order:

1. Quantify density-to-surface/SDF fidelity.
2. Use body-fitted-first refinement as the baseline.
3. Select ghost-node IBM or cut-cell research backend only after an explicit
   accuracy, adjoint, and implementation-cost comparison.
4. Add Hamilton–Jacobi updates, reinitialization, curvature control, and
   output-based adaptation.

Stage V acceptance requires three-grid body-fitted RANS evidence, pressure and
skin-friction decomposition, force/moment agreement, mesh-quality checks, and
cross-fidelity comparison with Stage T/Stage S.

## 11. Immediate execution order

The canonical `P @ rho` state is now consumed by a real solver case and the
`P.T @ topOSens` gradient returns to the canonical grid, verified by finite
differences. That item is complete; the sequence below reflects what the
2026-09-12 measurements changed.

1. **Make Stage T produce a design.** This is the only true blocker: nothing
   downstream can be demonstrated without it. Either repair the native
   formulation — the volume-constraint mechanism first, since it, not the
   downforce declaration, is the measured bottleneck — or drive the update from
   Python using the verified adjoint gradient with an explicit volume projection.
   Success is a bimodal density field with a substantial number of cells above
   0.5, a realized volume fraction near target, and a 0.5 iso-surface that is a
   real closed design surface rather than the six domain-boundary patches.
   **Implementation required.**
2. Fix the repository template's objective/constraint declaration so the solved
   problem matches the declared one, and add a check that refuses a Stage T run
   whose OpenFOAM objectives and constraints do not correspond to the
   ProblemSpec's declared objectives and constraints. The `--response-id` guard
   on the canonical gradient transfer is the first instance of this class of
   check; the optimization problem itself needs the same treatment.
   **Implementation required.**
3. Re-run the density -> iso-surface/SDF handoff on a real Stage T design and
   add the remaining surface-distance, self-intersection, minimum-feature and
   feature-survival gates, then produce one `ready_for_stage_s=true` canonical
   artifact. **Qualification implementation required.**
4. Re-evaluate the baseline and the optimized candidate with three-grid
   body-fitted OpenFOAM through `prepare-openfoam-from-problem-spec`, including
   pressure, skin-friction, total-force and cross-fidelity comparison. The
   force units and directions are now reconciled between the two fidelities;
   what remains is the study itself and its acceptance criterion.
   **Implementation required.**
5. Resolve or bound the approximately 10% directional-derivative bias on generic
   directions. Regularisation has been causally exonerated; the named untested
   candidate is `P`'s fractional-overlap redistribution under non-integer
   refinement ratios. Until it is understood, gradient-gate rows on
   non-gradient-aligned directions must not be read as pass/fail.
6. Establish a feasible seed or an explicit feasibility-restoration phase;
   add nonlinear candidate acceptance, rollback, and move-radius reduction.
   **Implementation required.**
7. Complete G3 and execute G4 B0–B2 before production optimizer work.
   **Implementation required.**
8. Implement production Stage T derivatives and a sparse/scalable constrained
   backend, then advance through B3–B5, Stage S refinement, and Stage V.

No new parametric candidate generator belongs to this execution sequence.
