# Authoritative Roadmap: Generic Aerodynamic Topology Optimization

Date: 2026-09-09
Status: authoritative
Scope: generic rigid-object external aerodynamics with topology change
Architecture decision: adopted on 2026-09-09

This is the only implementation roadmap for the project. Historical
body-fitted, parametric, and front-wing-specific work is capability evidence,
not a second development plan. The front wing remains the final complex
benchmark; it does not define the product architecture.

## September 2026 cross-platform implementation

The accepted [32 GB development design](development_plan_2026_09.md) and
[critical architecture review](architecture_review_2026_09.md) specify the
Mac/Windows extension. This page remains the authoritative progress record.
The existing G1–G4 gates below remain mandatory; the P0–P5 milestones in the
design are work packages, not substitutes for those gates.

The project adopts this architecture as its production direction: one shared
ProblemSpec and evidence contract, density/Brinkman topology exploration, SDF
sharp-interface refinement, and independent body-fitted verification. Backend
promotion remains conditional on the numerical and physical gates below. In
particular, adopting the architecture does not promote the current periodic
LBM probe to a target-aerodynamics solver.

The `main` snapshot immediately before this decision is preserved as
`artifact/pre-cross-platform-architecture-2026-09-09` at commit `fdc1053`.

The first implementation adds bounded `research` commands for runtime
inspection, STL/declared-feature preflight, and a periodic D2Q9 Taylor–Green
reference with an optional Apple Silicon Metal backend. These are P0/P1
foundations. CPU execution is portable; Metal acceleration requires Apple
Silicon. Windows CUDA acceleration is still pending. A working RTX 4070 Ti
must be qualified against its separate VRAM budget, not 32 GB host RAM.

The geometry preflight checks only its explicitly listed subset. Periodic
LBM has no wall treatment, force integration, SDF coupling, adjoint, or 3D
support. Neither its passing benchmark nor a successful OpenFOAM process
qualifies target aerodynamics or a complete optimization pipeline.

Next execution order:

1. Establish reproducible runtime and numerical evidence on Mac and Windows.
2. Validate wall treatment, force integration and spatial convergence on
   bounded laminar cases before coupling an SDF interface.
3. Add CUDA only behind the same reference tests and report memory/precision
   separately for each device.
4. Validate stationary residuals and directional derivatives before adjoints
   and constrained shape optimization; retain the existing density/Brinkman
   route for topology work and independent body-fitted verification.

See [cross-platform commands and evidence](cross_platform_research.md).

## 1. Product objective

Build a configuration-driven optimizer that can add, remove, join, and split
material inside a bounded design domain for an arbitrary STL-defined rigid
object, subject to aerodynamic, geometric, connectivity, and manufacturing
constraints.

The first supported product profile is deliberately bounded:

- incompressible low-Mach external flow;
- steady or quasi-steady analysis;
- one rigid material;
- STL-only geometry roles;
- uniform Cartesian fixed-grid topology optimization;
- SDF extraction/refinement followed by body-fitted verification.

Compressible flow, fully unsteady flow, fluid-structure interaction, free
surfaces, and production AMR are future capability profiles.

## 2. Authoritative architecture

        |
        v
Stage S: sharp-interface SDF refinement
        |
        v
Stage V: body-fitted RANS verification
```

The Stage T design variable is the cell density field `rho`. STL is an input
surface or a derived exchange/verification artifact; it is not the main
topology design variable.

## 3. Evidence rules

Every result must be labelled as one of the following:

| Evidence class | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Contract | Schemas, IDs, hashes, and validation agree. No solver claim. |
| Capability | A backend operation can run on a canonical fixture. |
| Numerical | Residual, mass-balance, stationarity, and gradient gates pass. |
| Target physics | The declared operating point and physics pass cross-fidelity checks. |
| Benchmark | A configured geometry family passes the complete acceptance set. |

Capability or contract evidence must never be reported as target-physics
validation. An `execution_ready` ProblemSpec means the declarations are
complete; it does not mean the mesh, fields, solver, or result are qualified.

## 4. Current position

| Workstream | Status | Current evidence and gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G0 scope/evidence model | Complete | Generic rigid-object scope and evidence classes are established. |
| G1 ProblemSpec/artifact contract | Complete | v2 parsing, canonical hash, multipoint responses, topology policy, v1 read-only migration, and semantic readers exist. |
| G2 case compiler | Current-spec numerical convergence passed; physical/native-artifact qualification pending | On 2026-09-07 both freshly compiled flows passed the declared primal, response, adjoint and normalized-mass convergence gates under the current specification hash. See `evidence/openfoam_convergence_2026_09.json`. Response-unit, gradient and grid-transfer semantics plus porous/body-fitted comparisons remain unqualified. |
| G3 geometry/resolution gates | Partial — bounded STL/declared-resolution preflight | `research preflight` checks STL metadata and declared feature/grid ratios. Self-intersection, actual shape thickness/clearance, complete mask/connectivity and density-to-SDF fidelity qualification remain. |
| G4 benchmark ladder | Missing — implementation required | No complete three-family, three-grid generic acceptance set exists. |
| Stage T canonical backend | Narrow numerical gate passed | Fixed-grid Brinkman primal/adjoints converged on the 8192-cell laminar fixture. At move/epsilon `1e-4`, directional derivatives agreed with finite differences within 2.23–4.35%, and an objective-only update agreed with primal re-evaluation within 4.51%. Move `0.03` was outside the useful local regime. See `architecture_effectiveness_2026_09.md`. |
| Stage T production optimizer | Missing — implementation required | Fail-closed native v2 writer/readiness diagnostics exist, but the real G2 run is awaiting semantic response-unit, `rho`-gradient, mesh-grid, and topology-value bindings. Generic-response gradients, production connectivity derivatives, nonlinear acceptance/rollback, checkpoint/resume, and GCMMA-equivalent iteration remain. |
| Stage S | Legacy handoff prototype only | Legacy point-data density-to-STL/SDF conversion exists. A Stage T cell-data `rho` to iso-surface/SDF bridge, quantitative fidelity gates, and a qualified sharp-interface solver do not. |
| Stage V | Prototype | Body-fitted OpenFOAM execution exists; target-profile grid convergence and cross-fidelity acceptance remain. |

The 2026-09-10 effectiveness spike proves only local numerical control inside
the fixed-grid Brinkman model. It does not prove constrained optimization or
the Stage T -> Stage S -> Stage V architecture end to end. The canonical start
is infeasible for the recorded efficiency and active-cell mean-`rho` limits,
and the current T5 output cannot be passed as the same candidate to Stage S/V.

## 5. G1 — generic problem and artifact contract

Status: complete.

The contract provides:

- coordinate frame and SI units;
- typed STL geometry roles;
- one or more flow cases with fluid, turbulence, boundary, and motion data;
- named force, moment, pressure-loss, flow-rate, and plugin responses;
- weighted objectives and aggregate constraints;
- solid/void connectivity and minimum-feature topology policies;
- deterministic snapshots and SHA-256 problem binding;
- flow-scoped and topology-scoped artifact keys;
- non-destructive v1 migration/read support.

G1 completion is contract evidence only.

## 6. G2 — solver compiler and target-physics bridge

Status: prior-spec numerical convergence gate passed; current canonical-domain
specification requires runtime requalification before physics qualification.

Implemented:

- `compile-openfoam-problem-cases` CLI;
- deterministic per-flow OpenFOAM cases and bundle metadata;
- incompressible Newtonian fluid properties;
- laminar and `k_omega_sst` profiles;
- freestream, pressure outlet, symmetry, stationary wall, and moving wall BCs;
- translation motion profiles;
- force-response adjoint managers and reference quantities;
- `Allrun`/`Allclean` and custom objective-library staging;
- fail-fast execution scripts;
- mesh patch-type compilation and requested/generated validation;
- primal/adjoint residual, normalized mass balance, response stationarity, and
  fatal-log convergence qualification.
- OpenFOAM v2512 Docker smoke execution for both configured G2 flow cases;
- real log extraction with response-to-adjoint context and provenance-bound,
  fail-closed convergence evidence.
- explicit boundary-`phi` mass-flux measurement and normalized-mass artifacts;
  raw continuity-error text is never converted into that metric.
- fail-closed native v2 primal/sensitivity writer and readiness CLI. It writes
  only when an explicit semantic binding proves response units, `rho` gradient
  convention, mesh-grid correspondence, and topology-policy values.
- fail-closed reconstruction of final decomposed `topOSens`, `alphaTilda`,
  `beta`, and raw-`alpha` provenance in OpenFOAM global-cell-label order;
  raw `topologySens` remains audit-only.
- source-grid reconstruction for one ungraded, axis-aligned `blockMesh` hex,
  plus hash-bound canonical-grid snapshots and exact-overlap transfer
  primitives. These contracts do not yet perform a real G2 transfer.

Current supported response compilation is force-only. Moment, pressure loss,
flow rate, rotating-wall motion, and plugin responses must be rejected
explicitly until implemented.

Remaining implementation:

1. Supply and qualify semantic bindings for native v2 primal and sensitivity
   artifacts from real runs. Both G2 flows were recompiled, rerun and numerically
   qualified under the current hash on 2026-09-07. Native export still requires
   evidence for the following semantic issues: its
   `porousDirectionalForce` output is a coefficient rather than proven `N`,
   its final `topOSens` to `rho` chain has not passed finite-difference
   validation, its reconstructed mesh fields have not been transferred to a
   canonical-grid snapshot, and it has no topology-policy values.
2. Qualify wall-distance/turbulence treatment; current `meshWave` metadata is
   not porous-aware and remains unqualified.
3. Compare porous and body-fitted pressure force, skin friction, total force,
   and gradient direction on simple geometries.

G2 smoke gate:

- compilation is `compile_ready=true`;
- requested/generated values and patch types match exactly;
- all setup applications and solver initialization complete without fatal
  errors;
- a run artifact is written even when the deliberately short smoke run is not
  numerically converged.

G2 qualification gate:

- all configured flow cases pass residual, normalized mass-balance, response
  stationarity, and adjoint-residual thresholds;
- porous/body-fitted comparisons are within documented tolerances;
- execution qualification is never inferred from an end marker alone.

## 7. G3 — geometry and physical-resolution gates

Status: partial — bounded STL and declared-resolution preflight implemented.
The full gate below remains required; the new command reports omitted checks.

Implement:

- unit and coordinate-frame validation;
- watertightness, orientation, self-intersection, and degenerate-face checks;
- fail-closed voxelization for critical roles;
- cells-per-feature checks for minimum solid width, void width, and gap;
- rejection when erosion/dilation radius is smaller than represented spacing;
- density-to-SDF volume error, surface/Hausdorff error, hard-mask violations,
  component/root preservation, and feature-survival metrics.

Acceptance fixtures must prove that a one-cell bridge fails, a sufficiently
wide bridge passes, and a no-op erosion cannot be reported as manufacturing
evidence.

## 8. G4 — benchmark ladder

Status: missing — implementation required.

Advance using YAML/STL replacement rather than benchmark-specific core code:

1. B0 geometry: sphere, box, thin plate, multiple components, invalid STL.
2. B1 numerical topology: islands and two-to-six-cell bridges; cellwise and
   filtered-random derivative checks.
3. B2 laminar 2D/2.5D: channel, cylinder, and NACA with three grids.
4. B3 turbulent bridge: flat plate and NACA porous/body-fitted comparison.
5. B4 generic 3D: finite wing, bluff body, and multi-component object.
6. B5 front wing: isolated wing, moving ground, roots/endplates, then optional
   vehicle and rotating-tire profiles.

Generic acceptance requires at least three geometry families, three-grid
evidence, filtered-random gradient checks, grey-density reporting,
extracted-geometry constraint status, and reproducibility metadata.

## 9. Stage T — production topology optimizer

Begin production T work only after G2 runtime qualification and the relevant
G3/G4 gates pass.

Implementation order:

1. Qualify real-run semantic bindings for the implemented fail-closed native
   v2 primal/sensitivity writer.
2. Generic response/objective/aggregate derivative assembly.
3. Production analytic/adjoint nominal and eroded connectivity derivatives.
4. Filter/projection continuation with explicit chain-rule metadata.
5. Nonlinear iteration with primal re-evaluation, acceptance/rollback, move
   bounds, checkpoints, resume, and deterministic artifacts.
6. GCMMA or equivalent constrained backend behind the existing optimizer
   interface.
7. Mesh epochs and conservative state/gradient transfer only after the uniform
   fixed-grid profile is qualified.

The existing projected-gradient and linearized SLSQP backends validate
plumbing; they are not the production nonlinear optimizer.

## 10. Stage S and Stage V

Stage S implementation order:

1. Quantify density-to-surface/SDF fidelity.
2. Use body-fitted-first refinement as the baseline.
3. Select ghost-node IBM or cut-cell research backend only after an explicit
   accuracy, adjoint, and implementation-cost comparison.
4. Add Hamilton–Jacobi updates, reinitialization, curvature control, and
   output-based adaptation.

Stage V acceptance requires three-grid body-fitted RANS evidence, pressure and
skin-friction decomposition, force/moment agreement, mesh-quality checks, and
cross-fidelity comparison with Stage T/Stage S.

## 11. Immediate execution order

1. Bind response units, reference quantities, `rho` gradient convention,
   mesh-grid mapping, and topology-policy values for one shared Stage T/V
   canonical problem. **Implementation required.**
2. Add a fail-closed T5 cell-density -> iso-surface/SDF artifact bridge and
   measure volume, surface, component/root, hard-mask, and feature-survival
   fidelity. **Implementation required.**
3. Re-evaluate the same initial and small-step candidates with three-grid
   body-fitted OpenFOAM, including pressure, skin-friction, total-force, and
   cross-fidelity comparison. **Implementation required.**
4. Establish a feasible seed or an explicit feasibility-restoration phase;
   add nonlinear candidate acceptance, rollback, and move-radius reduction.
   **Implementation required.**
5. Complete G3 and execute G4 B0–B2 before production optimizer work.
   **Implementation required.**
6. Implement production Stage T derivatives and a sparse/scalable constrained
   backend, then advance through B3–B5, Stage S refinement, and Stage V.

No new parametric candidate generator belongs to this execution sequence.
